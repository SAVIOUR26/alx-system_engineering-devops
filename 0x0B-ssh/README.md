# 0x0B. SSH

This repository is dedicated to learning objectives related to Secure Shell (SSH). By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

## Learning Objectives

### 1. What is a server? 🖥️

Gain an understanding of what a server is in the context of computing. Learn about the role of servers in providing services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients.

### 2. Where servers usually live 🏠

Explore the typical environments where servers are hosted. Understand the various types of server locations, including data centers, cloud infrastructure, and on-premises facilities.

### 3. What is SSH? 🔒

Learn about Secure Shell (SSH), a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over a potentially unsecured network. Understand the importance of SSH in providing secure access to remote systems.

### 4. How to create an SSH RSA key pair 🔑

Get hands-on experience in generating an SSH RSA key pair. Learn the steps involved in creating a public and private key pair, and understand how these keys are used for secure authentication.

### 5. How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair 🚀

Discover the process of connecting to a remote host using the SSH protocol and the RSA key pair generated earlier. Understand the security benefits of using key-based authentication compared to password-based authentication.

### 6. The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash 🔄

Explore the significance of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` in script shebangs compared to specifying the absolute path, such as `/bin/bash`. Understand the flexibility and portability advantages provided by the `env` command.

Feel free to navigate through the content in this repository to achieve a comprehensive understanding of SSH and related concepts. The practical exercises and explanations provided here aim to equip you with the knowledge and skills required for secure remote access and effective script execution.
