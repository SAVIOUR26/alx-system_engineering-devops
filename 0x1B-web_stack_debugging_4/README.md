# Web stack debugging #4

Welcome to the sixth installment of our web stack debugging series. Throughout these projects, I've been presented with malfunctioning web stacks enclosed in isolated containers. My primary mission was to troubleshoot and rectify the issues to restore the web stack to a functional state. For each challenge, I crafted a script to automate the essential commands required for the restoration process.
