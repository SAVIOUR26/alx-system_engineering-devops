# 0x16. API Advanced

## Overview

This project focuses on advanced API usage using Python scripting for backend development. The primary goal is to enhance your understanding of working with APIs, including reading API documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON results, making recursive API calls, and sorting dictionaries by value.

## Resources

Before starting this project, it's recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

### General

1. **Navigate API Documentation:** Understand how to effectively read API documentation to locate the specific endpoints you need for your project.

2. **Pagination Handling:** Learn how to deal with paginated API responses, ensuring that you can retrieve and process data spread across multiple pages.

3. **JSON Parsing:** Gain the ability to parse JSON results obtained from an API, extracting the relevant information needed for your application.

4. **Recursive API Calls:** Understand and implement recursive API calls, allowing you to retrieve nested or related data from an API.

5. **Dictionary Sorting:** Learn how to sort dictionaries based on their values, enabling you to organize and present data in a meaningful way.

## Project Structure

The project is organized around the aforementioned learning objectives. Each objective corresponds to a specific task or set of tasks that you will complete using Python for scripting and backend development.
